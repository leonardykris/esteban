              The Center for Asia Leadership (CAL) is a group of nonprofit international organizations that intentionally address public needs and problems in Asia through research, development, training, and publication initiatives in the areas of public service, political and social leadership, and education in Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
              We strongly believe that Asia will be the driver of next opportunities for the world. But despite its growing importance in both international politics and the global marketplace, there is not only a large knowledge gap but also a lack of initiatives of the opportunities that Asia has and can offer. There exists a vacuum of strong and effective political and social leadership on the ground in Asia, which is required to move the entire continent not only to become highly prosperous and advanced, but also to play responsible and meaningful roles in the global arena.
            </p>
            <p>
              We began our group with the belief that an organization should exist for the purpose of impacting society and can play effective roles in which to help it face its challenges. We seek to help Asia become better understood in the international community and help individuals and communities in this region face its challenges, identify opportunities, and turn downsides to upsides for their own well-being, thus to help promote prospects for democratic, thriving, and just, modern societies.
            </p>
            <p>
              A responsible, dynamic, and thriving Asia begins with the brightest and most-committed people on the ground engaging through actionable insights and effective plans. This is what CALI stands for and pursues.
