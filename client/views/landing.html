                    ‘Fostering innovation’ has become the mantra in Asia as the remedy to stagnant economies. But that is easier said than done – success will depend on a complex set of factors that include changes to policy, education, and even culture.

                  <p>
                    <b>Unrivaled Experience that Broadens the Mind:</b> The Trek is a learning journey through Asia unlike any other, pioneered by graduate students at the Harvard Kennedy School, where it has become a staple of its student experience. Trekkers travel and discover new places, sights, and sounds in a dynamic environment, and come away with a broadened perspective.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Lasting Connections, Global Network:</b> Trekkers are selected from a competitive pool of applicants who represent a diverse range of industries, countries and backgrounds. Through living and learning together with your peers, as well as engaging with individuals from all walks of life, you will gain a valuable worldwide professional network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Active Learning and Best Practices:</b> You take on the responsibilities and mindsets of diplomats, journalists, and teachers as you engage with policy, business, and society leaders. Trekkers form a mobile “think tank” engaged in on-the-ground experiential learning, capturing and testing new ideas and insights they can take back to their own setting.
